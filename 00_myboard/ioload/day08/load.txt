1	안녕하세요	이상욱	I tried making a new temp.txt file and writing the new contents into that, deleting this text file and renaming temp.txt to this one. Thing is, the deletion is always unsuccessful. I don't think I have to change user permissions for this do I?
2	반갑습니다.	김을진	My biggest "D'oh" moment! I've been compiling it on Eclipse rather than cmd which was where I was executing it. So my newly compiled classes went to the bin folder and the compiled class file via command prompt remained the same in my src folder. I recompiled with my new code and it works like a charm.
